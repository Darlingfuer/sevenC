Description: Chromatin looping interactions are an importent feature of
  eukaryotic genomes and can bring regulatory sequences such as enhancers in
  close physical proximity of regulated target genes.
  Here we provide a tool that uses protein binding signals from ChIP-seq and
  sequence motif information to predict chromatin looping events. It can be
  used to associate binding sites of transcription factors to regulated genes.
