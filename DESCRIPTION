Description: Chromatin looping is an importent feature of
  eukaryotic genomes and can bring regulatory sequences, such as enhancers or 
  transcription factor binding sites, in close physical proximity of regulated target genes.
  Here, we provide a tool that uses protein binding signals from ChIP-seq and
  sequence motif information to predict chromatin looping events. 
  Cross-linking of proteins binding close to loop anchors result in ChIP-seq 
  signals at both anchor loci. These signals are used at CTCF motif pairs 
  together their distance and orientation to each other to predict chromatin 
  looping interactions. The looping interactions can associate enhancers or 
  transcription factor binding sites (ChIP-seq peaks) to regulated genes.
