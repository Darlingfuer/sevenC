#' Prediction of Chromatin Looping Interaction from ChIP-seq and Sequnece
#' Motifs.
#'
#' Chromatin looping interactions are an importent feature of eukaryotic genomes
#' and can bring regulatory sequences such as enhancers in close physical
#' proximity of regulated target genes.
#' Here we provide a tool that uses protein
#' binding signals from ChIP-seq and sequence motif information to predict
#' chromatin looping events. It can be used to associate binding sites of
#' transcription factors to regulated genes.
