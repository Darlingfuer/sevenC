#' Computational chromosome conformation capture by correlation of ChIP-seq at
#' CTCF motifs (7C)
#'
#' Chromatin looping is an important feature of eukaryotic genomes and can bring
#' regulatory sequences, such as enhancers or transcription factor binding
#' sites, in close physical proximity of regulated target genes. Here, we
#' provide 7C, a tool that uses protein binding signals from ChIP-seq and
#' sequence motif information to predict chromatin looping events. Cross-linking
#' of proteins that bind close to loop anchors result in ChIP-seq signals at
#' both anchor loci. These signals are used at CTCF motif pairs together with
#' their distance and orientation to each other to predict whether they interact
#' or not. The resulting chromatin loops can be used to associate enhancers or
#' transcription factor binding sites (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) to regulated target
#' genes.
